    <h1>Pre-experiment Information</h1>

    <p><strong>Understanding the neural basis of recognition</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Jessica Taubert (School of Psychology, The University of Queensland)</p>

    <p>This experiment is one part of a project examining the factors that drive the recognition of objects in our everyday lives.</p>

    <p>In this experiment, you will be shown photographs of inanimate objects and asked to make a decision using your mouse. Your speed and accuracy will be recorded. Sitting in the same position for a long period may cause discomfort (e.g., anxiety or a headache). If this occurs, please notify the experimenter.</p>

    <p>You may withdraw at any time, without explanation or penalty. Data collected will be de-identified and stored securely. Data that contributes to a publication may be made publicly available via UQ eSpace.</p>

    <p>The experiment takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.</p>

    <p>This study adheres to the ethical guidelines of The University of Queensland. For concerns, contact Dr. Jessica Taubert at +61 7 3365 7181 or the Ethics Coordinators at +61 7 3365 3924 / +61 7 3443 1656 or email <a href="mailto:humanethics@research.uq.edu.au">humanethics@research.uq.edu.au</a>.</p>
